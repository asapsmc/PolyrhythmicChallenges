# Polyrhythmic Challenges

Repository supporting the CMMR 2023 post-symposium proceedings paper "Challenging Beat Tracking: Tackling Polyrhythm, Polymetre, and Polytempo with Human-in-the-Loop Adaptation", to be published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.

This repository contains the *Piano Phase* dataset used in our study, including:
- Audio files (`/pianophase/audio`): The main files are `pianophaseM_A` and `pianophaseM_B`, which contain the mixed audio of both streams with ground-truth annotations for streams A and B, respectively, each with a duration of 2 minutes. Additionally, `pianophaseA_A` and `pianophaseB_B` provide solo renditions of streams A and B, with corresponding annotations, and are included (as well as `pianophaseA_B` and `pianophaseB_A`)for testing purposes. 
- Beat annotations (`/pianophase/annotations/beats`): The ground-truth beat annotations;
- Pd patch (`/pd_patch`): used for generating the audio.
